# Winter School BTP Project

# I HOPE THIS IS IMPLEMENTED AS I HAVE SPEND AN ENTIRE SUNDAY CODING IT

To preview and run the project on your device, I like bun but you can use npm too:

1. Open project folder in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>
2. In the terminal, run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to view project in browser

The names of images in Public folder are quite wacky but its your mistake that's what you had named in the figma file. Despite asking for images multiple times, you always gave imcomplete set of images. Anyways feel free to change the names.
